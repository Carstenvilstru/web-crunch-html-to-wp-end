# Web-Crunch - HTML to WordPress Screencast Tutorial

Hi. This repo is a home for the end theme I create in a small series of videos that teach you how to take a free custom HTML template and translated it to a dynamic WordPress theme. 

#### Download Starter HTML

[HTML to WordPress "Start"](https://github.com/justalever/web-crunch-html-to-wp-start)


Getting Started
---------------

If you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your `_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the "Generate" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme. 

From there check out the videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/webcrunch) or [Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com) to follow along. A like, comment, subscribe, or any other feedback you have are greatly appreciated!
